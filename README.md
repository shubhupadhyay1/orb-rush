> *"Sometimes, the smallest stories leave the biggest impact."* ‚Äì Nobody said this about Orb Rush, but they should have.

## üéÆ About The Game

**Orb Rush** is a deceptively simple, emotionally resonant, cube-collecting adventure where you ‚Äî a humble sphere with a dream ‚Äî roll, dash, and collide through a blinding white void in search of... **meaning? closure? the final cube?**

Crafted in under an hour, but polished like a gem forged in an indie sweat lodge, **Orb Rush** takes minimalism to the **next dimension** ‚Äî literally. With zero narrative, no soundtrack, and nothing but cubes, it dares to ask:

> **"What if that‚Äôs all you need?"**

## üß† Features

- üßä **Interactive Cubes with Existential Weight**  
  Collect them. Destroy them. Ascend.

- üïπÔ∏è **One Control Scheme, Infinite Possibilities**  
  Arrow keys or WASD. That‚Äôs it. But it‚Äôs enough.

---

## üì¶ Built With

- **Unity (Built-in Render Pipeline)** ‚Äì Because sometimes, raw horsepower isn't as important as knowing where to coast.
- **TextMeshPro** ‚Äì For ultra-sharp, ultra-crisp, ultra-sincere UI experiences.
- **Blood, caffeine, and a burning desire to make *something* before lunch**
